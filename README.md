I've updated the following:

Accessibility Features:
Updated the HTML tag for English
Updated the img tag to include an alt for screen readers

Formatting:
I used an online formatter to ensure the code complies to industry standard.

Brand Guidelines:
Continued to follow the style guide on the current website.
Updated the colour scheme to use the 2 purples colours on https://etch.co/ homepage.
Updated the fonts to use Google Fonts - I tried to get one similar to your current website. I would ensure that the font was the same for production.

Form Updates
I've updated a few of the forms to ensure that the correct type is set (date/tel/etc)
For production, I would potentially update this to be a postcode and use Google Maps API to automatically input the users address based on the postcode.
